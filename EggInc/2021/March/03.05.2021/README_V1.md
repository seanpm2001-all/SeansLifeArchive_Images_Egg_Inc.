# First session

I got up really early today and had extra time. I should have tried to be productive in this time, but I didn't do anything that productive.

My first session with this game lasted about 2 hours, before I deleted the game again (I had it installed for several months being idle) and played my usual 2 Friday games for a shortened time period, then I reinstalled this game and started from new, so I could document it with screenshots.

At first, I didn't like the mechanic of using 4 fingers at once to press a button, it felt uncomfortable and looked scraggy (I used a Thesaurus for this, as I didn't want to use the word "gnarly" as it feels too 1980s like/surfer culture stereotype talk) but eventually I learned that I could just hold the button down, which was much more comfortable and efficient. Originally, with the 4 finger thing, I was thinking that a mode to only have the button would be necessary, as I would constantly press various other buttons when tapping at multiple points per second at random in a defined x and y range

It became an addiction today, and wasted a lot of my time. When I get addicted to a game, my normal productive boundaries just don't apply as well, and it is a fight to just quit. I know I needed to do stuff today, but I couldn't quit. I kept setting more and more goals, until I forced myself to quit near 2:30 pm, over 2 hours and 30 minutes after I originally planned to quit.

The game is a fun idle clicker game, but it has some bad monetization practices, and bad graphics. Other than that, it is good, and reminds me of [Bit City](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Bit_City_-NimbleBit_Game-) in several ways.

I have decided that for now, this will be a weekly game. If issues get worse, I might turn it into a monthly game, although I have to set strict limits for monthly activities.

It is good to have new experiences, so I was fine with adding this game. I have to be careful which games I add to monthly.

In my recorded session, I made back all my previous progress, and got even further up to (I think) rank 5.
